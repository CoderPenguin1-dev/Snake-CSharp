# C# Snake Game

An updated version of [my old snake game](https://github.com/PENGUINCODER1/Snake-Game) with improvements both game-wise and code-wise.
This was done mainly as a day project to improve the horrendous code that was the old project. This fixes some major oversights I had (like the recursion I had done in the old version) and some bugs in general.

The old repo will still be up, but only for archival reasons. Any further updates will be done here.

# Building
Clone the repo:
    
    git clone https://github.com/PENGUINCODER1/Snake-CSharp.git

Move into build directory:
    
    cd Snake-CSharp/SnakeRefactor

Build & Run Debug binary:
    
    dotnet run

It should open up afterwards. The build will be in `SnakeRefactor\bin\Debug\net6.0`.
